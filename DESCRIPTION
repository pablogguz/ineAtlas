    Statistical Office (INE) Household Income Distribution Atlas. The package downloads 
    and processes data from a companion GitHub repository (https://github.com/pablogguz/ineAtlas.data) 
    which contains processed versions of the official INE Atlas data. Functions are 
    provided to featch data at multiple geographic levels (municipalities, districts, 
    and census tracts), including income indicators, demographic characteristics,
    and inequality metrics. The data repository is updated every year when new releases are 
    published by INE.
