Description: Provides access to granular socioeconomic indicators from the
    Spanish Statistical Office (INE) Household Income Distribution Atlas.
    The package downloads and processes data from a companion 'GitHub'
    repository (<https://github.com/pablogguz/ineAtlas.data/>) which contains
    processed versions of the official INE Atlas data. Functions are
    provided to fetch data at multiple geographic levels (municipalities,
    districts, and census tracts), including income indicators,
    demographic characteristics, and inequality metrics. The data
    repository is updated every year when new releases are published by
    INE.
